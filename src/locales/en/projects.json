        "This project is a user-friendly web application that allows users to discover pet products, filter them by categories, prices, and discounts, apply discount codes, and place orders.",
        "The site features a clear structure, intuitive navigation, and a modern design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes."
      ],
      "goal": "The goal of the project was to implement the Figma design pixel-perfectly and develop a fully responsive online shop providing a pleasant shopping experience. This included category pages, product details, a cart, and an order form. The project was the final assignment of the frontend module and was implemented using React and modern web technologies.",
      "features": [

      "technologies": "React, Redux Toolkit, React Router Dom, Axios, React Hook Form, CSS Modules",
      "initial": "A full Figma design and a backend with data for categories, products, and orders were provided. The task was to implement the complete shop functionality and deliver a responsive, user-friendly experience.",
      "sequence": "I started by structuring the layout and building the homepage. Then I developed the category and product detail pages, implemented the shopping cart, and integrated API endpoints. Afterwards, I created the validation logic for the order form and the discount code form. I also implemented modal windows for successful form submissions. Finally, I optimized the responsive design and added a custom 404 page.",
      "problems": "Key challenges included structuring the global state for the cart, coordinating various UI components, and integrating the API with categories, product lists, and individual items. The filtering and sorting logic for price and discounts required particular attention. Implementing breadcrumb navigation and ensuring a stable responsive layout on very small screens were also demanding.",
      "learn": "Through this project, I deepened my knowledge of React, Redux Toolkit, and API integration. I learned to structure complex components logically, implement user-friendly form validation, and apply modern UX principles. I also improved my skills in responsive design and working with modals, routing, and error pages."

        "This project is a full-featured social media application that recreates key Instagram functionalities. Users can register, log in, create posts, like, comment, edit their profiles, and communicate via real-time WebSockets. The system also includes email verification, password reset, and a structured user management system.",
        "The platform combines a modern frontend with a stable backend API and a MongoDB database."
      ],
      "goal": "The goal of the project was to develop a fully functional social-media platform - consisting of backend, frontend, and database - that provides a complete user experience: registration, feed, interactions, and messaging. All components were expected to work seamlessly together to ensure a consistent user experience. Additionally, this project served as the final project of my full-stack training program, demonstrating the skills I acquired throughout the course.",
      "features": [
        "Registration and login with JWT",
        "Email verification after registration",

      "backend": "Node.js/Express, TypeScript, Mongoose, JWT, bcrypt, dotenv, multer, Docker",
      "database": "MongoDB, Mongoose",
      "initial": "For this training project, a Figma design and the concept of a social media app were provided. However, no technical system existed yet. All backend endpoints, database models, security mechanisms, and the entire frontend had to be developed from scratch.",
      "sequence": "I began with the backend: designing MongoDB/Mongoose database models, implementing registration, login, JWT authentication, and email verification. Then I built CRUD features for posts, likes, comments, the follow system, and notifications. Next, I integrated WebSockets for real-time chat. Afterwards, I developed the frontend based on the Figma design and implemented all required features. Finally, I connected frontend and backend and tested the complete workflow.",
      "problems": "The biggest challenge was implementing WebSockets, particularly the client-side integration in the frontend. Image uploads, JWT-protected routes, email verification, and reliable error handling also required careful planning. Moreover, coordinating data flows between frontend, backend, and database had to be done very precisely.",
      "learn": "Through this project, I gained a deep understanding of full-stack development. I learned to build stable backend structures, design meaningful data models, implement secure token authentication, handle file uploads and email services, and use WebSockets for real-time features. In addition, I learned to develop a complex frontend with React and Redux and connect it smoothly to an API. Overall, I gained valuable experience in combining frontend and backend into a single, well-designed application."

      ],
      "goal": "The main goal of this project was to develop a responsive design that ensures an optimal user experience across devices and screen sizes - following the Figma design. The project was implemented during my frontend course using HTML, CSS, SASS, and JavaScript.",
      "features": [
        "Filtering events by date, type, distance, and category",
        "Responsive design for different screen sizes",

      ],
      "technologies": "HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript (Vanilla)",
      "initial": "At the beginning, I received a Figma design and a set of mock data, but no existing website. The goal was to implement a fully responsive platform based on the design and fulfill all functional requirements. Sass was used to put theoretical knowledge into practice. Since no backend was provided, all data was processed exclusively from mock data.",
      "sequence": "I first created the homepage with header, main section, and footer. Then I developed the events page and gradually integrated the filtering logic for date, category, type, and distance. Finally, I optimized responsiveness and added dynamic header and footer rendering.",
      "problems": "The most challenging parts were the responsive adjustments, as several sections of the layout changed significantly depending on the screen width. The event cards required many detailed adjustments as well. The filtering logic was also complex, especially when combining multiple filters and handling online vs. offline events differently.",
      "learn": "I expanded my knowledge of responsive web design, worked confidently with Sass, and learned how to build a multi-step filtering system. I also strengthened my skills in dynamic DOM rendering and implementing complex layouts."
