      "My professional journey did not start in computer science, but in business and management. At school, I was already fascinated by mathematics and IT, but I initially decided to study economics. Only later - in parallel with my family phase - did I deliberately move into IT and systematically build up my technical skills.",
      "For more than eight years, I worked as system administrator in a large e-commerce company. There I was close to day-to-day IT operations, managed roles and permissions, kept systems stable, and collaborated closely with other departments. This time showed me how important reliable infrastructure, clear processes, and good communication are.",
      "The war in Ukraine was a tough turning point. Together with my children, I had to leave my hometown Vinnytsia and start over in Germany. In Dessau-Roßlau, I learned the German language from scratch, expanded my IT skills, and eventually completed my web development training with very good results.",
      "Today, I combine my experience from system administration, further training, and projects into a clear profile: structured, high-quality web development with an understanding of infrastructure, teamwork, and real-world requirements. What excites me most is implementing complex topics in a way that users can interact with them intuitively.",
      "Outside of work, nature and creativity help me stay balanced. Hiking in the mountains and forests helps me clear my head and stay focused. My love for plants and handmade decorations reflects my eye for detail - the same patience and care that I bring into programming. For me, good software is no coincidence, but the result of many well-considered decisions."
