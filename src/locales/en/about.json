  "about_text": "I build modern web applications with a strong focus on usability, performance, and clean architecture. My foundation combines eight years of experience in system administration with a completed training in web and full-stack development. I work in a structured and reliable way, with attention to quality and detail — from infrastructure to UI. Regular mountain and forest hikes help me stay focused and persistent, while my creative hobby of crafting floral decorations sharpens my patience and sense of aesthetics. In a team, I value open communication, ownership, and a solution-oriented approach. My goal is to create lasting value through maintainable code and a holistic understanding of technology."
